# Advanced Rubik's Cube Simulator - Development Specification

## Project Overview
Create a highly realistic, fully functional Rubik's Cube simulator with complete 3D visualization, authentic solving algorithms, and comprehensive customization options. The simulator should replicate the look, feel, and behavior of a real Rubik's Cube as closely as possible.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Visual Presentation & 3D Graphics
- **Realistic 3D rendering** with proper lighting, shadows, and reflections
- **Authentic cube proportions** matching the original Rubik's Cube design
- **Smooth animations** for all rotations and movements with realistic physics

- **Rounded edges and corners** to match the actual cube's appearance
- **Sticker/face texturing** that looks like real cube stickers with slight imperfections
- **Interactive camera controls** (rotate, zoom, pan) for examining the cube from all angles
- **High-quality materials** with appropriate shininess and color saturation

### 2. Cube Mechanics & Interaction
- **Multiple cube sizes**: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8, 9x9, and 10x10
- **Intuitive controls**: 
  - Mouse drag to rotate faces
  - Keyboard shortcuts for standard notation (R, L, U, D, F, B, M, E, S, x, y, z)
  - Touch support for mobile devices
- **Smooth face rotations** with configurable animation speed
- **Click and drag interface** with visual feedback showing which face will rotate
- **Proper cube physics** - only allow legal moves

### 3. Advanced Solving System
**This is crucial**: The simulator must implement actual Rubik's Cube solving algorithms, not just reverse move sequences.

#### Required Solving Methods:

  - Last layer corners permutation
  - Last layer edges permutation

- **CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL)**
  - Advanced F2L algorithms
  - Complete OLL algorithm set (57 algorithms)
  - Complete PLL algorithm set (21 algorithms)

- **Roux Method** (optional advanced feature)
- **ZZ Method** (optional advanced feature)

#### Solving Features:
- **Real-time solving**: Show the cube being solved step by step with explanations

### 5. Control Panel & User Interface
- **Speed controls**: Animation speed slider (slow motion to instant)
- **Color customization**: 
  - Traditional color scheme (White, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow)
  - Custom color picker for each face
  - Color-blind friendly palettes
  - Preset color schemes (stickerless, pastel, neon, etc.)
- **Cube size selector**: Easy switching between 2x2 through 10x10
- **Solving options**:
  - Choose solving method
  - Step-by-step vs. automatic solving
  - Show/hide algorithm names
  - Solving speed adjustment

  - Current scramble sequence
  - Move counter
  - Timer functionality
  - Solve history and averages

### Performance Requirements:
- **Smooth 60 FPS** animation on modern browsers
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Efficient memory usage** for larger cubes (up to 10x10)
- **Fast algorithm execution** - solving should feel instantaneous for smaller cubes
- **Progressive loading** for complex 3D assets

### Code Architecture:
- **Modular design** with separate classes for:
  - Cube representation and state management
  - 3D rendering and animations
  - Algorithm implementation
  - User interface components
  - Solving logic
- **Clean separation** between cube logic and visual representation
- **Extensible algorithm system** for easy addition of new solving methods
- **Comprehensive error handling** and user feedback

## Algorithm Implementation Notes
- IMPORTANT: Implement actual cube-solving logic, not just move reversal
- Use proper cube notation and standard algorithm notation
- Include pattern recognition for automated solving
- Store algorithms as move sequences that can be applied to any cube state
- Implement look-ahead and optimization for advanced solving methods

## Quality Standards
